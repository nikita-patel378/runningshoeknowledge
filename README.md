# Running Shoe Knowledge 

## Overview
After completing countless races for over a decade, I wanted to create a way to share my knowledge of running shoes to help others narrow down their decision when it comes to choosing shoes that serve their running goals. This project leverages a **graph database (Neo4j)** to model essential shoe characteristics and a **Streamlit app** to provide an interactive way for users to query relevant details.

## Features
- **Graph Database Structure**: Models key attributes such as **offset, cushioning, support type, and brand insights**.
- **Streamlit App**: Provides a user-friendly interface for querying shoe characteristics.
- **Shoe Segmentation Use Case**: Helps users find shoes based on characteristics relevant to their running needs.

## Next Steps
This is the first iteration of organizing running shoe knowledge. The next phase will introduce **LLMs (Large Language Models)** to enable more natural, conversational queries, allowing users to describe their needs in plain language and receive personalized recommendations.

## Demo
